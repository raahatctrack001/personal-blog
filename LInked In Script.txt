Introduction: 
Thrilled to announce the completion of the backend development for 
my latest project, a personal blog website! This project marks a 
significant milestone in my journey as a full stack developer, 
showcasing efforts in designing and implementing robust, 
scalable, and efficient backend systems. 
I meticulously crafted the backend architecture to ensure 
seamless data management, user authentication, and content delivery.
As this is merely a version 1 of backend API's.
Through meticulous attention to detail and a passion for clean code, 
I will optimized database queries, implemented RESTful APIs, and integrate
essential security measures to safeguard user data. This project not 
only demonstrates my technical proficiency but also underscores my 
commitment to delivering high-quality solutions that exceed client 
expectations. Excited to continue improving and integrating backend 
development and eager to explore new opportunities to contribute my 
skills and expertise to innovative projects.

Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC)
Project management methodology used:
In Version 1(dated 08 April 2024), waterfall model has catched my eyes for fast development of project.
Planning -> Analysis -> Design -> Implementation (Coding) -> Testing -> Deployment -> Maintenance
Project has been completed till Implementation phase, we are about to enter testing phase for backend.

but in coming version of projects, we will try to Introduce agire scrum as our management methodology
though project isn't large enough to adopt agile but let's do it the better way.

Certainly! Here's how you can express your decision in technical terms:

I've made a strategic decision to adopt a structured approach to 
managing my time between competitive programming platforms like 
LeetCode and Codeforces, and my software development activities. 
To achieve a balanced utilization of my technical skills, 
I've decided to allocate weekdays primarily to problem-solving 
on platforms such as LeetCode and Codeforces. This allows me to 
focus on honing my algorithmic problem-solving abilities, mastering
data structures, and enhancing my problem-solving skills. 
dedicating weekends to software development activities, 
I ensure that I have uninterrupted blocks of time to immerse 
myself in designing, implementing, and refining real-world software
projects. This approach enables me to maintain a healthy balance 
between improving my problem-solving capabilities and applying them 
in practical software development scenarios, ultimately enhancing my
overall proficiency as a software engineer.

As i completed my backend code structure this weekend, hope to come up with frontend
for the same project in coming weekend.
Stay tuned!
Thank you
